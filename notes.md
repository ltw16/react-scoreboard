Unidirectional Data Flow: All data in our applications flow in a single direction. In React it flows down the tree from parent to child. 

Application State: The state or data in our application that is core to the functionality of the application. This is the data that is displayed and manipulated by the application. Application state should be managed as high up as possible in the application. 

Local Component State: This is the state or data that is required for a component to function. This data is not used by other components in the application.
